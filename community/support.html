<p>For community support or dozer enhancement requests check out the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/dozer-mapper">Google
Group</a> . We value your enhancement suggestions and want to build
something of value to the Java community. When submitting bug and
feature requests, it is really helpful if you are able to submit a
simplified unit test case(s) that reproduce the issue. We understand
this is not possible for every request, but if you are able to submit a
unit test it usually results in the request being implemented sooner.</p>
