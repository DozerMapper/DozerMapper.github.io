Central shortly. Project has migrated to bintray for hosting binary

=== Dozer 5.4.0 is out _2012-12-01_
Release 5.4.0 is available for download. This is the first release after
moving project to GitHub and already few new contributors have joined.

For discussions about new features post here
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/dozer-mapper[Google
Group]. For technical questions use
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dozer[StackOverflow] All issue
tracking will be done here
https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues[GitHub] Old SourceForge
Forums and Issue tracker will not be active anymore. They will be
disabled once migration is finished.

=== Dozer is on GitHub _2012-06-28_
After some inactivity period Dozer has finally moved to
https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/[GitHub]. Source code will be
maintained there from now on. This transition is a huge step forward for
the project as the barrier for contribution is significantly lower on
GitHub compared to SourceForge. It is really easy to create a Pull
request and merge it afterwards. Transition of the issue trackers and
support forums will be performed as well. We are looking forward to
accept contributions from developers in forms of patches and help on
migration to GitHub. Write to buzdin at gmail if you are interested.

summer.

This release contains bug fixes and feature requests, along with
internal refactoring. Some new features include indexed mapping within

The most significant refactoring was around Map backed properties. The
refactoring did not change the public Dozer API or the xml dtd, but if
you are currently using the Map backed property features of Dozer please
thoroughly regression test your system after upgrading to 4.0 to verify
that any expected behavior remains unchanged for your specific use
cases. We do have a good amount of unit tests around the Map backed
property feature, but please let us know if you experience any issues
after upgrading and we will do everything we can to resolve it soon as
possible.

Thanks again to everyone that submitted bug and feature requests, along
with everyone that contributed to the release.
