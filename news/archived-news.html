<p>After some inactivity period Dozer has finally moved to
<a href="https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/">GitHub</a>. Source code will be
maintained there from now on. This transition is a huge step forward for
the project as the barrier for contribution is significantly lower on
GitHub compared to SourceForge. It is really easy to create a Pull
request and merge it afterwards. Transition of the issue trackers and
support forums will be performed as well. We are looking forward to
accept contributions from developers in forms of patches and help on
migration to GitHub. Write to buzdin at gmail if you are interested.</p>
