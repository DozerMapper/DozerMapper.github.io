is Dozer?\n\n\nDozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.\nTypically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.\n\n\nDozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping,\nimplicit-explicit mapping, as well as recursive mapping.\nThis includes mapping collection attributes that also need mmapping at the element level.\n\n\nPlease read the about page for detailed information on Dozer.\n\n\n"},"documentation/whymap.html":{"url":"documentation/whymap.html","title":"Why Map?","keywords":"","body":"\nWhy Map?\n\n\nA mapping framework is useful in a layered architecture where you are\ncreating layers of abstraction by encapsulating changes to particular\ndata objects vs. propagating these objects to other layers (i.e.\nexternal service data objects, domain objects, data transfer objects,\ninternal service data objects). A mapping framework is ideal for using\nwithin Mapper type classes that are responsible for mapping data from\none data object to another.\n\n\nFor distributed systems, a side effect is the passing of domain objects\nbetween different systems. Typically, you won’t want internal domain\nobjects exposed externally and won’t allow for external domain objects\nto bleed into your system.\n\n\nMapping between data objects has been traditionally addressed by hand\ncoding value object assemblers (or converters) that copy data between\nthe objects. Most programmers will develop some sort of custom mapping\nframework and spend countless hours and thousands of lines of code\nmapping to and from their different data object.\n\n\nA generic mapping framework solves these problems. Dozer is an open\nsource mapping framework that is robust, generic, flexible, reusable,\nand configurable.\n\n\nData object mapping is an important part of layered service oriented\narchitectures. Pick and choose the layers you use mapping carefully. Do\nnot go overboard as there is maintenance and performance costs\nassociated with mapping data objects between layers.\n\n\nParallel Object Hierarchies\n\nThere could be different reasons of why application should support\nparallel object hierarhchies. To name a few:\n\n\n\n\nIntegration with External Code\n\n\nSerialization Requirements\n\n\nFramework Integration\n\n\nSeparation of Architectural Layers\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases it is efficient to guard your code base from frequently\nchanging object hierarchy, which you do not control directly. In this\ncase Dozer serves as a bridge between application and external objects.\nAs mapping is performed in reflective manner not all changes break your\nAPI. For example if object changes from Number to String the code will\nkeep working as this is resolved automatically.\n\n\nSome frameworks impose Serialization constraints, which does not allow\nsending any Java objects through the wire. One of the popular examples\nis Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework, which restricts developer to\nsending only objects compiled to JavaScript and marked as Serializable.\nDozer helps to convert Rich Domain Model to Presentation Model, which\nsatisfies GWT serialization requirements.\n\n\nDozer integrates nicely with frameworks use JAXB implementations.\nWith help of provided factory classes, conversion\nbetween domain model and Xml objects is defined in the same way as plain\nobject to object mappings.\n\n\nIn complex enterprise application it is often valuable to separate\ndesign to several architectural layers. Each of them would reside on its\nown abstraction level. A typical simplified example would be\npresentation, domain and persistence layers. Each of this layers could\nhave own set of Java Beans representing data relevant for this layer. It\nis not necessary that all data will travel to the upper levels of\narchitecture. For example the same domain object could have different\nmappings dependant of the presentation layer requirements.\n\n\n\n"},"documentation/gettingstarted.html":{"url":"documentation/gettingstarted.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"\nGetting Started\n\n\nDownloading the Distribution\n\nIf you are using Apache Maven, simply copy-paste this dependency to your project.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper\n    dozer-core\n    6.3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Mapping\n\nFor your first mapping, lets assume that the two data objects share all common attribute names.\n\n\n\nMapper mapper = DozerBeanMapperBuilder.buildDefault();\nDestinationObject destObject = mapper.map(sourceObject, DestinationObject.class);\n\n\n\nAfter performing the Dozer mapping, the result will be a new instance of the destination object that\ncontains values for all fields that have the same field name as the source object.\nIf any of the mapped attributes are of different data types, the Dozer mapping engine will automatically\nperform data type conversion.\nAt this point you have completed your first Dozer mapping.\nLater sections will go over how to specify custom mappings via custom xml files.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: For real-world applications it is NOT recommended to create a new instance of the Mapper\neach time you map objects but reuse created instance instead.\n\n\n\nSpecifying Custom Mappings via XML\n\nIf the two different types of data objects that you are mapping contain any fields that don’t share a common property name,\nyou will need to add a class mapping entry to your custom mapping xml file.\nThese mappings xml files are used at runtime by the Dozer mapping engine.\n\n\nDozer automatically performs any type conversion when copying the source field data to the destination field.\nThe Dozer mapping engine is bi-directional, so if you wanted to map the destination object to the source object,\nyou do not need to add another class mapping to the xml file.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Fields that are of the same name do not need to be specified in the mapping xml file.\nDozer automatically maps all fields with the same property name from the source object into the destination object.\n\n\ni.e.:\n\n\n\n\n    yourpackage.yourSourceClassName\n    yourpackage.yourDestinationClassName\n    \n        yourSourceFieldName\n        yourDestinationFieldName\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe complete Dozer mapping xml file would look like the following.\nThe Custom Mappings section contains more information on mapping options that\nare available to you for more complex use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        true\n        MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm\n        true\n    \n    \n        yourpackage.yourSourceClassName\n        yourpackage.yourDestinationClassName\n        \n            yourSourceFieldName\n            yourDestinationFieldName\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nDozer and Dependency Injection Frameworks\n\nDozer is not dependant of any existing Dependency Injection framework (DI).\nHowever the general aim is to support the most typical use cases with ready-to-use wrappers.\nCheck Spring Integration manual for option of initializing Dozer\nin context of Spring DI framework.\n\n\n\n"},"documentation/usage.html":{"url":"documentation/usage.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"\nUsage\n\n\nDozer Bean Mapper\n\nBefore we go over setting up custom xml bean mappings, let us look at a simple example of using Dozer.\nThe Dozer mapping implementation has a method called map which takes a source object and either\na destination object or destination object class type.\nAfter mapping the two objects it then returns the destination object with all of its mapped fields.\n\n\n\nMapper mapper = DozerBeanMapperBuilder.buildDefault();\nDestinationObject destObject = mapper.map(sourceObject, DestinationObject.class);\n\n\n\nOr…​\n\n\n\nDestinationObject destObject = new DestinationObject();\nmapper.map(sourceObject, destObject);\n\n\n\nDozer operates in two general modes: implicit and explicit.\n\n\nImplicit mode is activated by default and tries to resolve mappings for you.\nIt uses simple assumptions that if two objects are passed for mapping then bean properties with\nthe same names should be mapped. If there are additional mappings needed,\nwhich can not be derived by the naming you should add those either via\nXML, annotations or API.\n\n\nExplicit mode assumes that no mappings should be performed or \"guessed\" until you have specified those specifically.\nThe amount of coding is higher in explicit mode, but sometimes you would like to have  full control on\nwhat is going on during the mappings process and this approach is also used in many of the productive applications.\nImplicit/Explicit mapping switch is called \"wildcard\" in Dozer.\n\n\n\nInjecting Custom Mapping Files\n\nThe Dozer mapping xml file(s) define any custom mappings that can’t be automatically performed by the Dozer mapping engine.\nAny custom Dozer mapping files need to be injected into the Mapper implementation\nvia DozerBeanMapperBuilder#withMappingFiles(..) method.\n\n\nPreferably, you will be using an IOC framework such as Spring for these Dozer injection requirements.\nAlternatively, the injection of mapping files can be done programmatically.\nBelow is a programmatic approach to creating a bean mapper.\nNote that this is NOT the recommended way to retrieve the bean mapper.\nEach new instance needs to be initialized and this consumes time as well as resources.\nIf you are using the mapper this way just wrap it using the singleton pattern.\n\n\n\nMapper mapper = DozerBeanMapperBuilder.create()\n        .withMappingFiles(\"dozerBeanMapping.xml\", \"someOtherDozerBeanMappings.xml\")\n        .build();\n\nDestinationObject destObject = mapper.map(sourceObject, DestinationObject.class);\n\n\n\n\nSpring Integration\n\nThe following is an example how the Mapper bean would be configured via Spring.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            dozer-global-configuration.xml\n            dozer-bean-mappings.xml\n            more-dozer-bean-mappings.xml\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},"documentation/mappings.html":{"url":"documentation/mappings.html","title":"Mappings via XML","keywords":"","body":"\nCustom Mappings Via Dozer XML Files\n\n\nThis section will cover setting up custom mappings in xml file(s).

Since\nDozer started during Xml-hype years more than five years ago that was\npretty obvious choice back then. After that Java 5 brought us\nannotations and new industry accepted style of configuring behaviour are\nDomain-Specific Languages. DSL-like support is provided in form of\nmapping API, but since version 5.3.2 Dozer starts providing annotations\nsupport as well.\n\n\nThe obvious reasons to use annotations is to avoid duplicating field and\nmethod names in your mapping code. The annotation can be put onto the\nmapped property itself thus reducing the amount of code. However there\nare cases when annotations should be avoided or even impossible to use.\nSome of them are the following:\n\n\n\n\nYou are mapping classes, which are not under your control, but\nprovided in libraries;\n\n\nThe mappings are quite complex and require many configurations;\n\n\n\n\nIn the first case you could be mapping JAXB generated entities or\nthird-party DTOs and have no possibility to put annotations. In the\nsecond case there is a choice of putting lots of multi-line annotations\nor isolating the mapping code with certain duplication of entity names.\nOverannotated beans could be problematic to read and understand.\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nWARNING: Annotation support in Dozer is experimental and does not\ncover complex use cases yet. However it may be useful to implement that\nsimplest mappings you have had to do in Xml or API before.\n\n\nThe idea is very simple. You put @Mapping annotation either on getter of\nfield directly. If Dozer finds that it adds a bi-directional mapping. It\nmeans that putting annotation once will create mappings for both\nconversion types. Type conversions (e.g. String-Long) will be chosen\nautomatically. Global custom converters are resolved as well.\nAnnotations work only if a conversion is subject to wildcard rule\n(active by default). The following example demonstrates annotations in\naction.\n\n\n\npublic class SourceBean {\n\n    private Long id;\n\n    private String name;\n\n    @Mapping(\"binaryData\")\n    private String data;\n\n    @Mapping(\"pk\")\n    public Long getId() {\n        return this.id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return this.name;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\npublic class TargetBean {\n\n    private String pk;\n\n    private String name;\n\n    private String binaryData;\n\n    public void setPk(String pk) {\n        this.pk = pk;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nMapping the given beans with Dozer will result in all three fields being\nmapped. Property \"name\" will be mapped by naming convention. Property\n\"id\" will be transformed to \"pk\". Field \"data\" will be moved to\n\"binaryData\". Do not worry about private modifier; it will be handled\nautomatically.\n\n\nCurrently Dozer offers only one annotation, but the next ones will be\nadded in following releases. As for now you can mix and match all\nflavours of mapping types to achieve the desired effect: Xml, API and\nAnnotations.\n\n\n\n"},"documentation/apimappings.html":{"url":"documentation/apimappings.html","title":"via API","keywords":"","body":"\nAPI Mappings\n\n\nXML Mapping Flaws\n\nXML-based approach is stable and is used in many production projects.\nHowever, it imposes several limitations.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, and most important, is that it can not be dynamically\ngenerated. All XML mappings should be present on Dozer start-up and can\nnot be modified afterwards. There are tricky ways, when you can generate\nand put mappings to the file system by your own templating engine, but\nthis approach is not supported by Dozer itself. By generating custom\nmappings you are able to automate repetitive chunks of low-level Dozer\nlanguage.\n\n\nSecond problem is that you are forced to duplicate all of your Bean\nclass names in Xml mappings. This leads to lots of typing and copy-paste\nprogramming. This can be partly compensated by use of Expression\nLanguage inside Xml, but it is not solving all of the problems.\n\n\nRefactoring support is limited as IDE should keep track of class names\nin Xml files and change them when you rename or move the referenced\nclass.

To convert a\nCollection/Array to a Collection/Array with different type objects dozer\ncan determine parameterized types at runtime.\n\n\n\npublic class UserGroup {\n\n  private Set users;\n\n  public Set getUsers() {\n    return users;\n  }\n\n  public void setUsers(Set aUsers) {\n    users = aUsers;\n  }\n\n}\npublic class UserGroupPrime {\n\n  private List users;\n\n  public List getUsers() {\n    return users;\n  }\n\n  public void setUsers(List aUsers) {\n    users = aUsers;\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\nObject Array to List (bi-directional)\n\nWhen converting an Object array to a List, by default the destination\nList will contain the same data type as the source Array.\n\n\n\n\n\n    arrayForLists\n    listForArray\n\n\n\n\nUse a hint for data type conversion. Because a hint is specified, the\ndestination List will contain String elements instead of Integers.\n\n\n\n\n\n    arrayForLists\n    listForArray\n    java.lang.String\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimitive Array to Primitive Array (bi-directional)\n\nWhen converting an Object array to an Array, by default the destination\nArray will contain the same data type as the source Array.\n\n\n\n\n\n    anArray\n    theMappedArray\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative vs. Non-Cumulative List Mapping (bi-directional)\n\nIf you are mapping to a Class which has already been initialized, dozer\nwill either 'add' or 'update' objects to your List. If your List or Set\nalready has objects in it dozer checks the mapped List, Set, or Array\nand calls the contains() method to determine if it needs to 'add' or\n'update'. This is determined using the relationship-type attribute on\nthe field tag. The default is 'cumulative'. relationship-type can be\nspecifed at the field mapping, class mapping, or global configuration\nlevel.\n\n\nglobal configuration level…​.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        non-cumulative\n    \n\n\n\n\nclass mapping level…​.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.TestObject\n        com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.TestObjectPrime\n        \n            someList\n            someList\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nfield mapping level…​.\n\n\n\n\n\n    hintList\n    hintList\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.TheFirstSubClass\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.TheFirstSubClassPrime\n\n\n\n\n    unequalNamedList\n    theMappedUnequallyNamedList\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you do not define custom equals() and hashCode() methods\nnon-cumulative option will not function properly, as Dozer will fail to\ndetermine object equality and will rely on JDK generated object Ids. In\ndefault case two instances of a class are always treated as different\nand update will not occure.\n\n\n\nRemoving Orphans\n\nOrphans are elements which exist in a destination collection that did\nnot exist within the source collection. Dozer will remove orphans by\ncalling the 'remove' method on actual orphans of the underlying\ndestination collection; it will not clear all. To determine elements\nwhich are orphans dozer uses the contains() method to check if the\nresults contains orphans.

The map\ncan either implement the java.util.Map Interface or be a custom map with\na set of unique Get/Set methods.\n\n\nIn this example Field A is a basic String and it is mapped to Field B\nwhich is a HashMap.

If you are using a custom map you must explicitly\nset the map Get/Set method names. A destination hint can also be\nprovided if your custom map implements an Interface or is an Abstract\nclass.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.PropertyToMap\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.MapToProperty\n    \n        stringProperty3\n        customMap\n    \n    \n        stringProperty4\n        nullCustomMap\n        com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.CustomMap\n    \n    \n        stringProperty5\n        customMap\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nMapping Class Level Properties to a java.util.Map or a Custom Map with unique Get/Set methods\n\nDozer can also map entire complex objects directly to a java.util.Map or\na custom map object. This example shows the declaration of a mapping\nbetween a complex object (PropertyToMap) and a java.util.Map. When doing\nthis you need to explicitly define a unique map-id for the mapping. This\nis used when determining which map to use at run-time. Every attribute\non the PropertyToMap class will be mapped to the java.util.Map. You DO\nNOT need to explicitly define these mappings. Field exclude mappings can\nbe used to exclude fields at run-time. If the attribute name is not the\nsame as the map key just set the key attribute for a custom field\nmapping. The mapping to stringProperty2 shows an example of this.\n\n\nThe second example shows how to setup a custom map object. The only\ndifference here is that you need to explicitly define map-set-method and\nmap-get-method values. These correspond to the java.util.Map get() and\nput() methods.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.PropertyToMap\n    java.util.Map\n    \n        stringProperty2\n        this\n    \n    \n        excludeMe\n        this\n    \n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.PropertyToMap\n    \n      com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.CustomMap\n  \n    \n        stringProperty2\n        this\n    \n    \n        excludeMe\n        this\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe example below shows how to use these mappings. Notice that the field\nmappings reference a map-id. The first field mapping will use the\nmyTestMapping defined mapping and map accordingly.

For this dozer has a new API. In addition to the source and\ndestination classes you can now pass in the map reference Id.\n\n\n\n// Example 1\nPropertyToMap ptm = new PropertyToMap();\nptm.setStringProperty(\"stringPropertyValue\");\nptm.addStringProperty2(\"stringProperty2Value\");\nMap map = Mapper.map(ptm, HashMap.class, \"myTestMapping\");\n\n// Example 2\nCustomMap customMap = mapper.map(ptm, CustomMap.class, \"myCustomTestMapping\");\n\n// Example 3\nCustomMap custom = new CustomMap();\ncustom.putValue(\"myKey\", \"myValue\");\nMapper.map(ptm, custom, \"myCustomTestMapping\");\n\n// Example 4 - Map Back\nMap map = new HashMap();\nmap.put(\"stringProperty\", \"stringPropertyValue\");\nPropertyToMap property = mapper.map(map, PropertyToMap.class, \"myTestMapping\");\nassertEquals(\"stringPropertyValue\", property.getStringProperty());\n\n\n\n\n"},"documentation/proxyhandling.html":{"url":"documentation/proxyhandling.html","title":"Proxy Objects","keywords":"","body":"\nProxy Objects\n\n\nOverview\n\nDozer supports mappings done on proxy objects.

For example, if you\nwant to use a custom converter for mapping between an array of objects\nand a String you would use the following mapping notation. Dozer\ngenerically uses ClassLoader.loadClass() when parsing the mapping files.\nFor arrays, java expects the class name in the following format:\n[Lcom.github.dozermapper.core.vo.SimpleObj;\n\n\n\n\n    [Lcom.github.dozermapper.core.vo.SimpleObj;\n    java.lang.String\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for primitives\n\nYou can specify a custom converter for primitive types. Just use the\nprimitive wrapper class when defining the custom converter mapping. In\nthe following example, Dozer will use the specified custom converter\nwhen mapping between SomeObject and the int primitive type. Note that\nDozer will also use the custom converter when mapping between SomeObject\nand the Integer wrapper type.\n\n\n\n\n    somePackage.SomeObject\n    java.lang.Integer\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurable Custom Converters\n\nYou can define a custom converter, which can be configured from mappings\nvia configuration parameter. In this case you should implement\nConfigurableCustomConverter interface instead of usual CustomConverter.\nConfigurable converter has additional attribute provided in runtime -\nparam. Parameter is provided using custom-converter-param attribute.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.BeanA\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.BeanB\n    \n        amount\n        amount\n    \n\n\n\n\nConfigurable custom converter should be used when you have similar\nbehaviour in many cases, which can be parametrized, but the number of\ncombinations is too high to do simple Custom Converter subclassing.\n\n\n\nimport com.github.dozermapper.core.ConfigurableCustomConverter;\nimport com.github.dozermapper.core.MappingException;\n\npublic class MathOperationConverter implements ConfigurableCustomConverter {\n\n    private String parameter;\n\n    @Override\n    public void setParameter(String parameter) {\n        this.parameter = parameter;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Object convert(Object existingDestinationFieldValue, Object sourceFieldValue, Class destinationClass, Class sourceClass) {\n        Integer source = (Integer)sourceFieldValue;\n        Integer destination = (Integer)existingDestinationFieldValue;\n\n        if (\"+\".equals(parameter)) {\n            return destination.intValue + source.intValue();\n        }\n\n        if (\"-\".equals(parameter)) {\n            return destination.intValue - source.intValue();\n        }\n\n        throw new MappingException(\"Converter MathOperationConverter \"\n                                   + \"used incorrectly.

This results in\nconverter, which code is difficult to understand and to reuse in other\nways than plugging into Dozer mapping. However it is not uncommon\nsituation when the same conversion logic should be called from a place\nother than bean mapping framework.\nversion of Dozer gets shipped with new - cleaner API for defining\ncustom converter, which gives you more obvious API while taking away\ncertain part of control of the executions flow. The following example\ndemonstrates simple, yet working converter using new API.\n\n\n\nimport com.github.dozermapper.core.DozerConverter;\n\npublic class NewDozerConverter extends DozerConverter {\n\n    public NewDozerConverter() {\n        super(String.class, Boolean.class);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Boolean convertTo(String source, Boolean destination) {\n        if (\"yes\".equals(source)) {\n            return Boolean.TRUE;\n        } else if (\"no\".equals(source)) {\n            return Boolean.FALSE;\n        }\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unknown value!\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String convertFrom(Boolean source, String destination) {\n        if (Boolean.TRUE.equals(source)) {\n            return \"yes\";\n        } else if (Boolean.FALSE.equals(source)) {\n            return \"no\";\n        }\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unknown value!\");\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nNote that Java 5 Generics are supported and you do not need to cast\nsource object to desired type as previously.\n\n\n\nData Structure Conversions\n\nThere are cases where it is required to perform programmatic data\nstructure conversion, say copy each odd element in a list as map key,\nbut each even as map value.

For example, a data object that has a\nfield named \"message\" should have getMessage and setMessage methods.\nData objects that don’t follow this pattern are also supported, but will\nmost likely require a custom mapping definition. For these unorthodox\ndata objects, you can tell Dozer to directly access fields(including\nprivate) and/or explicitly specify which get/set methods to use.\n\n\n\nWill Dozer automatically perform data type conversions?\n\nYes. Most scenarios are supported out of the box. These include\nprimitives, Java Wrapper Objects, Number subclasses, Dates, Calendar,\nCollections, Arrays, Maps, and Complex types\n\n\n\nDoes Dozer automatically map fields with matching property names?\n\nYes. All fields with matching property names are implicitly mapped. It\nwould be atypical usage, but you could suppress this behavior by setting\nwilcard=\"false\".\n\n\n\nIs Dozer recursive?\n\nYes. Dozer recursively maps the entire object graph for all fields.\n\n\n\nWill the getter and setter methods be invoked when fields are mapped?\n\nYes. You can bypass this default behavior by explicitly specifying\nis-accessible=\"true\" for any of your mappings. If is-accessible is\nspecified, the field(including private fields) is accessed directly and\nthe getter/setter methods are bypassed. It is not recommended that you\nset is-accessible=\"true\", unless you are dealing with an unorthodox data\nobject that does not contain any getter or setter methods.\n\n\n\nAre Collections and Arrays supported?\n\nYes. Dozer automatically maps between collection types and automatically\nperforms any type conversion.\n\n\n\nAre Map type objects(i.e HashMap) supported?\n\nYes. All Java Map data types are supported in addition to any Custom map\ndata types.\n\n\n\nAre abstract classes, inheritance, and interface mapping supported?\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nCan Dozer be configured via Spring?\n\nYes. Refer to Spring Integration section of\nthe documentation.\n\n\n\nWhich types of data mappings do I need a custom xml mapping definition for?\n\nOnly fields that can’t be implicitly mapped by matching on field name,\nneed a custom xml mapping definition. Ideally, the vast majority of your\nfield mappings can be performed automatically and only the few\nexceptional cases will need an explicit field mapping in the xml mapping\nfile.\n\n\n\nIf my src and dest object have all matching attribute names, do I need to specify any xml mapping definitions at all?\n\nNope. Just invoke the mapper. You don’t need any explicit xml mapping\nentries for this combination of source and destination object.\n\n\n\nFor mappings that require an xml mapping definition, is the mapping definition bi-directional, or do I need 2 xml definitions if I need to map the two objects both ways?\n\nAll mapping definitions are bi-directional, so you only need one mapping\ndefinition. You can map a -→ b and b-→ a using this single mapping\ndefinition.\n\n\n\nHow are the custom xml mapping files loaded?\n\nDozer will search the entire classpath looking for the specified\nfile(s).\n\n\n\nCan I load a mapping file that is not in the classpath?\n\nYes, you can load files from outside the classpath by prepending \"file:\"\nto the resource name. Ex) \"file:c:\\somedozermapping.xml\"\n\n\n\nHow can I tell if Dozer is initializing correctly and loading my xml mapping files?\n\nSet the -Ddozer.debug system property. If this is set, Dozer\ninitialization information is also sent to System.out. If you are\nfamiliar with log4j, this is similar to the -Dlog4j.debug system\nproperty\n\n\n\nHow does Dozer perform?\n\nWe believe Dozer performs very well and performance is a high priority\nfor us. We have spent a significant amount of time profiling the code\nand optimizing bottlenecks.\n\n\nPerformance is going to depend on the complexity of the use case and the\nnumber of fields mapped. In our performance tests for \"average\" mapping\nscenarios, the class mapping times vary from 1/8 of a millisecond to 2\nmilliseconds. This roughly equates to 50 - 450 field mappings per\nmillisecond. However, the number of variables in any decent benchmark\nmakes it almost impossible to transfer these results into reasonable\nconclusions about the performance of your own application. Your\napplication is different and you will have unique use cases.\n\n\nDozer has been successfully implemented on large, very high\ntransactional enterprise systems, without any resulting performance\nissues. But we always recommend that you run performance tests on your\napplication to determine the actual performance costs within your\nsystem. You can decide for yourself whether those costs are acceptable\nin the context of the entire system.\n\n\n\nWhich JDK versions are supported?\n\nJDK 1.8 and above.\n\n\n\nIs Dozer in the maven repository?\n\nYes and we will continue to do our best to get future releases of Dozer\nuploaded into the repository.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper\n    dozer-core\n    {dozer-version}\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Dozer good for the environment?\n\nYes, dozer does not burn any fossil fuels and is within the EPA’s\nrecommended emissions.\n\n\n\nCan I implement custom mapping logic between 2 data types and have Dozer invoke this custom logic when it’s performing mappings?\n\nYes. A very useful feature provided by Dozer is the concept of custom\nconverters. Custom converters are used to perform custom mapping between\ntwo objects. In the Configuration block, you can add some XML to tell\nDozer to use a custom converter for certain class A and class B types.\nWhen a custom converter is specified for a class A and class B\ncombination, Dozer will invoke the custom converter to perform the data\nmapping instead of the standard mapping logic.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.SomeCustomDoubleObject\n        java.lang.Double\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCan I map one field into another field that is nested n layers deep in the destination object?\n\nYes. Dozer supports dot notation for nested fields. As with other dozer\nfield mappings, these are bi-directional.\n\n\n\n\n    someNestedObj.someOtherNestedObj.someField\n    someOtherField\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I map multiple fields to a single field?\n\nDozer doesn’t currently support this. And because of the complexities\naround implementing it, this feature is not currently on the road map. A\npossible solution would be to wrap the multiple fields in a custom\ncomplex type and then define a custom converter for mapping between the\ncomplex type and the single field. This way, you could handle the custom\nlogic required to map the three fields into the single one within the\ncustom converter.\n\n\n\nIf I am mapping data objects that contain bi-directional relationships, will it result in an infinite loop and eventual stack overflow error?\n\nNo. Dozer has built in logic that prevents infinite loops for\nbi-directional data object relationships\n\n\n\nHow do I map an object contained in a collection to a field?\n\nYou would use indexed based mapping.\n\n\n\n\n    usernames[0]\n    username1\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I map a Complex object to a HashMap and vice versa?\n\nYou can map entire complex objects directly to a java.util.Map and vice\nversa. When doing this you need to explicitly define a unique map-id for\nthe mapping. This is used when determining which map to use at run-time.\nEvery attribute on the complex type will be mapped to the java.util.Map.\nYou DO NOT need to explicitly define these mappings. If the attribute\nname is not the same as the map key just set the key attribute for a\ncustom field mapping.\n\n\n\n\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.map.SomeComplexType\n    java.util.Map\n    \n        stringProperty2\n        this\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I map fields that don’t have corresponding getter/setter methods?\n\nYou can tell Dozer to directly access fields(including private fields)\nby specifying is-accessible=\"true\"\n\n\n\n\n    fieldA\n    fieldB\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of my data objects don’t have public constructors. Does Dozer support this use case?\n\nYes. When creating a new instance of the destination object if a public\nno-arg constructor is not found, Dozer will auto detect a private\nconstructor and use that. If the data object does not have a private\nconstructor, you can specify a custom BeanFactory for creating new\ninstances of the destination object.\n\n\n\nDoes Dozer support JDK 1.5 enums?\n\nYes. Enum to Enum mapping is automatically handled.\n\n\n\nDoes Dozer support JAXB generated data objects?\n\nDozer has support for mapping POJOs to JAXB objects. Use the\nJAXBBeanFactory for any JAXB objects you want created.\n\n\n\nIs there an Eclipse plugin or visual editor for Dozer?\n\nNo, but we think it would be a great addition. It would be very powerful\nto be able to graphically map 2 objects and have the custom xml\ndefinitions auto generated, along with being able to visually view a\nmapping definition. If anyone has expertise in creating eclipse plugins\nand is interested on working on this feature, please let us know!\n\n\n\nWhen mapping collections, how do I tell Dozer what type of data objects I want in the destination collection?\n\nHints are supported to handle this use case. Hints are not required if\nyou are using JDK 1.5 Generics because the types can be auto detected by\nDozer. But if you are not using generics, to convert a Collection/Array\nto a Collection/Array with different type objects you can specify a Hint\nto let Dozer know what type of objects you want created in the\ndestination list. If a Hint is not specified for the destination field,\nthen the destination Collection will be populated with objects that are\nthe same type as the elements in the src Collection.\n\n\n\n\n    someList\n    otherList\n    com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.TheFirstSubClassPrime\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I tell Dozer to bypass mapping null or empty string values?\n\nYou can bypass the mapping of null values by specifying\nmap-null=\"false\". If this is specified, the dest field mapping is\nbypassed at runtime and the destination value setter method will not be\ncalled if the src value is null. This can be specified at the mapping or\nclass level.\n\n\nYou can bypass the mapping of empty String values by specifying\nmap-empty-string=\"false\". If this is specified, the dest field mapping\nis bypassed at runtime and the destination value setter method will not\nbe called if the src value is an empty String. This can be specified at\nthe mapping or class level\n\n\n\nShould I encapsulate logic that copies data between objects?\n\nIt is our opinion that you should. Regardless of whether you use Dozer\nto perform data mapping between objects, we believe this is a good\ndesign pattern that promotes reuse, encapsulates the underlying\nimplementation, and makes the code unit testable in isolation. These\n\"Assembler\" interfaces encapsulate the logic that is responsible for\ntaking a src object and mapping the data into a dest object. Using\nassembler type of classes gives you the flexibility of being able to\nmodify the underlying mapping implementation without impacting clients\nor the contract. One other important benefit of using Assemblers is that\nit makes writing unit tests specific for the mapping a lot easier and\nmore focused. If you ever need to determine if a particular bug is due\nto mapping of objects, it is simple to write an Assembler unit test that\nreproduces the use case. If you encapsulate your data mapping logic, you\ncould use Dozer for most of mappings and if you have a real corner case,\nyou have the flexibility to hand code mappings for any objects or\nfields. For example, you could run your mapping through Dozer to map 99%\nof your fields and then have a manual mapping for some odd ball field.\nThis would happen all within the Assembler without the client having any\nknowledge of the underlying implementation.\n\n\nIt seems to work best if these assembler type of classes are \"dumb\" and\nare only responsible for simply copying data from the source object into\nthe destination object. Any complex postprocessing business logic that\nneeds to be performed on the destination object can be done at a higher\nlevel in classses that have more responsibility.\n\n\nThe following is a simple example of an assembler type class that uses\nDozer for its underlying implementation.\n\n\n\npublic class SomeAssemblerImpl implements SomeAssembler {\n\n  private Mapper dozerMapper;\n\n  public DestObject assembleDestObject(SrcObject src) {\n    return dozerMapper.map(src, DestObject.class);\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nShould I write unit tests for data mapping logic that I use Dozer to perform?\n\nAbsolutely. And of course, we strongly recommend writing the unit\ntest(s) first. Even if you don’t use Dozer to perform the data mapping\nbetween two objects, this logic still needs isolated unit tests. Data\nmapping logic(especially hand coded) is error prone and having a unit\ntest is invaluable. Typically mapping between two objects is required in\nmultiple areas of a system, so a focused unit test of the central\nmapping logic enables you to test the data mapping logic in isolation.\nThe great thing about encapsulating data mapping logic and having unit\ntests for the logic is that you can easily switch out the underlying\nimplementation.\n\n\nFor existing systems that are wanting to migrate to Dozer, we recommend\nfirst encapsulating any existing hand coded data mapping into an\nassembler type of class and write unit tests for it. Then switch out the\nhand coded mapping logic with Dozer and the unit tests will be your\nsafety net. The migration to Dozer can be incremental and this is\nprobably the best strategy for exisiting systems.\n\n\nRegardless of whether or not you use Dozer, unit testing data mapping\nlogic is tedious and a necessary evil, but there is a trick that may\nhelp. If you have an assembler that supports mapping 2 objects\nbi-directionally, in your unit test you can do something similar to the\nfollowing example. This also assumes you have done a good job of\nimplementing the equals() method for your data objects. The idea is that\nif you map a source object to a destination object and then back again,\nthe original src object should equal the object returned from the last\nmapping if fields were mapped correctly. In the test case, you should\npopulate all the possible fields in the original source object to ensure\nthat all of the fields are accounted for in the mapping logic.\n\n\n\npublic void testAssembleSomeObject() throws Exception {\n  SrcObject src = new SrcObject();\n  src.setSomeField(\"somevalue\");\n  src.setSomeOtherField(\"make sure you set all the src fields \"\n    + \"with values so that you fully test the data mappings\");\n\n  DestObject dest = assembler.assembleDestObject(src);\n  SrcObject mappedSrc = assermbler.assembleSrcObject(dest);\n\n  assertEquals(\"fields not mapped correctly\", src, mappedSrc);\n}\n\n\n\nIt is also good practice to verify that your assembler handles null\nvalues properly. In the following test case none of the source fields\nare populated. If the assembler doesn’t properly handle null values, an\nexception will be thrown when the assembler is invoked.\n\n\n\npublic void testAssembleSomeObject_NullValues() throws Exception {\n  SrcObject src = new SrcObject();\n\n  DestObject dest = assembler.assembleDestObject(src);\n  SrcObject mappedSrc = assermbler.assembleSrcObject(dest);\n\n  assertEquals(\"fields not mapped correctly\", src, mappedSrc);\n}\n\n\n\n\nShould the Dozer mapper be configured as a Singleton?\n\nYes. Mapper instances should be reused as much as possible. For every\ninstance of the Mapper, the mapping files are loaded and\nparsed. You should configure the Mapper once for your configuration\nand reuse this instance throughout your application. The\nMapper implementations are thread safe.\n\n\n\nIs it better to have 1 large xml mapping file or to have multiple smaller mapping files?\n\nWe recommend componentizing your mapping files instead of having 1 large\nmapping file.\n\n\n\nWhat are the best ways to debug Dozer?\n\nYou can specify the -Ddozer.debug system property to view the one time\ninitialization information. You will see output similar to the\nfollowing…​.\n\n\n\ndozer: Trying to find Dozer configuration file: dozer.properties\ndozer: Using URL [file:/local/subversion_projects/dozer/trunk/target/test-classes/dozer.properties] for Dozerglobal property configuration\ndozer: Reading Dozer properties from URL[file:/local/subversion_projects/dozer/trunk/target/test-classes/dozer.properties]\ndozer: Finished configuring Dozer global properties\ndozer: Initializing Dozer. Version: ${project.version}, Thread Name:main\ndozer: Initializing a new instance of the dozer bean mapper.\ndozer: Using the following xml files to load custom mappings for the bean mapper instance:[fieldAttributeMapping.xml]\ndozer: Trying to find xml mapping file: fieldAttributeMapping.xml\ndozer: Using URL [file:/local/subversion_projects/dozer/trunk/target/test-classes/fieldAttributeMapping.xml]to load custom xml mappings\ndozer: Successfully loaded custom xml mappings from URL:[file:/local/subversion_projects/dozer/trunk/target/test-classes/fieldAttributeMapping.xml]\n\n\n\nTo debug individual field mappings between classes, set the logging\nlevel \"com.github.dozermapper.core.MappingProcessor=DEBUG\". For example, if you are using\nlog4j you would add the following entry to your log4j configuration file\n\"log4j.category.com.github.dozermapper.core.MappingProcessor=DEBUG\". This will show you\nevery field mapping that Dozer performs along with the actual source and\ndestination values. You will see output similar to the following…​.\n\n\n\nMAPPED: SimpleObj.field1 --> SimpleObjPrime.field1 VALUES:\none --> one MAPID: someMapId\nMAPPED: SimpleObj.field2 --> SimpleObjPrime.field2 VALUES:\n2 --> 2 MAPID: someMapId\nMAPPED: SimpleObj.field3 --> SimpleObjPrime.field3 VALUES:\n3 --> 3 MAPID: someMapId\nMAPPED: SimpleObj.field4 --> SimpleObjPrime.field4 VALUES:\n44.44 --> 44.44 MAPID: someMapId\nMAPPED: SimpleObj.field6 --> SimpleObjPrime.field6 VALUES:\n66 --> 66 MAPID: someMapId\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the best way to setup the global configuration?\n\nWe recommend having a separate mapping xml file for global\nconfiguration. You could name it something similar to\ndozer-global-configuration.xml. Sample global configuration file…​…​\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        true\n        MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm\n        false\n        \n            \n                com.github.dozermapper.core.vo.CustomDoubleObject\n                java.lang.Double\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the best way to submit a bug, feature request, or patch?\n\nWe value your suggestions and appreciate everyone that takes the time to\nsubmit a support request.
